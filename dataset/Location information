If there is a number of movement name such as Box# where # is a number, it specified a different testing location than the default.

2: The opposite of the defult. Start facing down at top-left corner of the default path
3: In the back of the lab. (Feature rich)
4: In the hallway outside the lab, directly infront of the lab door. (Feature poor)
5: In the hallway outside the lab, further away from the door we it can see elevator. (Feature poor)
6: Big opening (where I used to test fly drone once). (Drastic change in lighting)

Note that the first location 2 has 6 reults (3 for using extrinsic pose and 3 for not using it). However, the rest of the test will not use extrinsic pose guess as it performs more consistently and allows for EKF fusion node to work properly.

At 4, when returning to origin VO fail when it see both close wall and hall way.
At 6, when facing directly at the window where it light is shining in, the VO fails immediately.
